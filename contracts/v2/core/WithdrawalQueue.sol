/**
 * @title WithdrawalQueue
 * @author @ChimeraDefi - chimera_defi@protonmail.com | sharedstake.org
 * @dev -
 * ERC-7540 inspired withdrawal contract
 * This contract is designed to be used with SharedDepositMinterV2 contract
 * As a module extension that adds 7540 methods requestRedeem and redeem
 * Example flow ->
 * user calls requestRedeem(user, user, userShares)
 * user calls setOperator(admin OR protocol provided keeper, true)
 * admin can now call redeem on the users behalf if needed after epoch
 * user calls redeem(user, user, userShares) after waiting for epoch
 * Caveats:
 * If the user requests another redemption, before fulfillment,
 * this resets the epoch length clock for their request
 * Basic upgrade path:
 * 1. Call togglePause(1), this disables the requestRedeem fn so no new requests
 * 2. Deploy new contract, direct users to it
 * 3. Fulfill any remaining redeemRequests i.e. totalPendingRequest,
 * for all RedeemRequest events from requestsFulfilled to requestsCreated
